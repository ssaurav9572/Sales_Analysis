# Sales Analysis Using Python (Pandas)
Project Overview

This project involves analyzing sales data using Python and Pandas to gain insights into business performance. The analysis aims to answer key business questions such as the best month for sales, the top-selling city, and the most frequently purchased products. By cleaning, merging, and analyzing data from multiple CSV files, this project provides actionable insights that can help optimize inventory management, marketing strategies, and sales operations.
